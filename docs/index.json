    "keywords": "About Me Hello! I'm Manuel and I have been programming games for around 9 years . Since childhood, I have always been very passionate towards videogames. In 2013 I was finally able to start developing them and I haven't stopped since. I would describe myself as proactive, inborn problem solver and always looking forward to learning new skills. Highly autonomous, yet communicative and team focused. Due to my knowledge in Unity and Git, I often find myself being asked about these topics and over the years I found myself having developed quite a few mentoring skills . Trained in all aspects of videogame development thanks to a wide education, and many years being an indie dev. â€Ž"
