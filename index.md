# **About Me**

Hello! I'm Manuel and I have been **programming games for around 9 years**. Since childhood, I have always been very passionate towards videogames. In 2013 I was finally able to start developing them and I haven't stopped since.

I would describe myself as proactive, inborn **problem solver** and always looking forward to learning new skills. Highly autonomous, yet communicative and team focused. Due to my knowledge in Unity and Git, I often find myself being asked about these topics and over the years I found myself having developed quite a few **mentoring skills**.

**Trained in all aspects of videogame development** thanks to a wide education, and many years being an indie dev.
